The scripts of this project can be found in `program_scripts` and ran like so:
 sh local.sh <seqs.txt> <mat.m> <gap penalty>
 sh seeding.sh <db.txt> <query.txt> <mat.m> <k> <T>
 sh extension.sh <db.txt> <mat.m> <seeds.txt> <X> <S>
 sh statistics.sh P4db.txt pam250.m

The program has 4 main files. Each correspond to a problem of the project, on the whole corresponding to the BLAST algorithm used in genomic research.

The only auxiliary file I created were two test files, test_cases/seeding/query3.txt and databases/db3.txt.

No known bugs.
